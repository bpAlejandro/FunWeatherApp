# FunWeatherApp
App to advise about the weather telling you what you could wear.

This is a simple browser app made by using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Live demo was deployed here: https://funweatherapp.netlify.app/

## How to test it your own?
This app has been done in Visual Studio Code (v1.91.1)

The weather source data is from [https://openweathermap.org/](https://openweathermap.org/)


- Download the repository.

- Replace the API Key variable inside the main.js with your own API Key from [https://openweathermap.org/](https://openweathermap.org/).
    To find your own API key you only need to register, click on your profile and go to My API Keys.
    
- Once done, save the file.

- I deployed the project folder in [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). However, you can also use it locally.
  *The easiest way of doing it locally is by opening the project folder in Visual Studio Code, install the ['Live Server' extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer), and use the live server icon to deploy the project locally on your main browser.*
